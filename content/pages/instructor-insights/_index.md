Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _16.90 Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering_ as it was taught by Professors Karen Willcox and Qiqi Wang in Spring 2014.

This course provided an introduction to numerical methods and computational techniques arising in aerospace engineering. Applications were drawn from aerospace structures, aerodynamics, dynamics and control, and aerospace systems. Techniques covered included numerical integration of systems of ordinary differential equations; numerical discretization of partial differential equations; and probabilistic methods for quantifying the impact of variability. Specific emphasis was given to finite volume methods in fluid mechanics, and finite element methods in structural mechanics.

This course was taught using the [Residential MITx platform](https://openlearning.mit.edu/mit-faculty/enhance-your-teaching-mit). 

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Attain a conceptual understanding of computational methods commonly used for analysis and design of aerospace systems
*   Achieve a working knowledge of computational methods, including experience implementing them in model problems drawn from aerospace engineering applications
*   Possess a basic foundation in theoretical techniques to analyze the behavior of computational methods

Instructor Insights
-------------------

{{< quote "Because students came to class having already engaged with the course materials, we were able to use in-class time for recitation-style interactions. Instead of lecturing for the full session, we focused on talking through the difficult parts of the theory and methods they had read about before class. Flipping the classroom also created opportunities for problem-solving in class." "— Karen Willcox" >}}

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class
--------

*   Course met 2 times a week for 1.5 hours per session; 25 sessions total.
*   WebEx broadcasting of class sessions allowed students time away from campus to participate in engineering competitions or presenting at conferences.
*   Sessions included concept questions, small group exercises, and project work.

Out of Class
------------

*   Online readings that included multiple choice, true/false, and short answer questions
